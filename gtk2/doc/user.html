<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> these instructions require root access to your 
computer.  If you want to install AiksaurusGTK on a computer that isn't 
yours, you should get permission from your systems administrator first.
</p>

<dl><dt><strong>Step 1: Install GTK+</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>AiksaurusGTK requires the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> library to 
work correctly.  Most Linux systems will already have this installed.  You can 
run the command:
</p>
<p><code>gtk-config --version</code></p>
<p>To find out what version of GTK you have installed.  If you get the message 
"command not found", this means that you will need to install GTK+ first.  
Please consult the GTK+ web site for how to do this.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<br />

<dl><dt><strong>Step 2: Install Aiksaurus Core Library</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>AiksaurusGTK also requires the <a href="http://www.aiksaurus.com/">Aiksaurus</a>
core library.  Your system probably does not have this installed already.  However,
you can run the command:
</p>
<p><code>aiksaurus --version</code></p>
<p>To find out what version of the core library you have installed.  If you get
the message "command not found", this means you will need to install the core library
first.  Please consult the Aiksaurus web site for how to do this.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<br />

<dl><dt><strong>Step 3: Download AiksaurusGTK Package</strong></dt>
<dd>

<p>You should now be ready to download 
<a href="http://www.aiksaurus.com/gtk/">AiksaurusGTK</a>.  </p>

<p>You should download a file named AiksaurusGTK-?.??.tar.gz 
(where ?.?? is the most recent version of AiksaurusGTK). 
</p>

<p>Now, this is a compressed file.  You should be able to extract 
it by running the commands: </p>
<p><code>
gunzip AiksaurusGTK-?.??.tar.gz<br />
tar xvf AiksaurusGTK-?.??.tar
</code></p>

<p>This will create the directory AiksaurusGTK-?.??.  Go to this new directory
and type in:</p>

<p><code>
./configure
</code></p>

<p>This should do a lot of stuff and eventually tell you something like:
</p>

<p><code>
config.status: creating Makefile<br />
config.status: creating src/Makefile<br />
config.status: creating src/config.h<br />
</code></p>

<p>If so, you've configured to build successfully.  If not, please check your 
dependencies (steps 1 and 2).  If this fails, send me an email and we'll figure 
out what's wrong.
</p>

<p>Once ./configure is done, you should be able to compile the program using 
the command </p>

<p><code>make</code></p>

<p>This should spit out a lot of output and not produce any errors.  If it does 
produce an error, please email me because there's a serious problem.
</p>

<p>Finally, you need to become root (via "su") and run the command</p>

<p><code>make install</code></p>

<p>This will install a library to /usr/lib, a header file to /usr/include, and 
a program to /usr/bin.  You can then become your regular user again (via "exit").  AiksaurusGTK should now be installed.
</p>

<p>You can test your installation by running the command:</p>
<p><code>AiksaurusGTK</code></p>

<p>Which should pop up the thesaurus.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<br />
<dl>
<dt><strong>Step 4: Cleaning Up (optional)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can delete the entire Aiksaurus-?.?? directory that was created, and the 
Aiksaurus-?.??.tar file that you downloaded.  These files are not needed for
Aiksaurus to run, and can clear up some disk space.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Using the Thesaurus</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The thesaurus should be fairly self-explanatory.  The back and forward buttons
let you go to previous and future searches like a web browser.  The dropdown box
in the toolbar lets you type in words to search for or access recent searches.  
Finally, you can double-click on listed synonyms to jump to them.
</p>

<p>There are some command line switches which can be viewed by running
</p>

<p><code>AiksaurusGTK --help</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Uninstallation Instructions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you still have the Aiksaurus-?.?? directory around, you can uninstall the
thesaurus by running "make uninstall" in that directory.  This will require 
root access.
</p>

<p>If you deleted that directory, you can still manually uninstall by deleting
the files:
</p>
<ul> 
 <li>/usr/lib/libAiksaurusGTK.*
 <li>/usr/include/AiksaurusGTK.*
 <li>/usr/bin/AiksaurusGTK
</ul>
