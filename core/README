    Common Build Problems and Solutions
   
      1.  Thesaurus programs fail on startup with 'cannot open shared 
          library libAiksaurus.so.0'

          By default, libAiksaurus.so.0 is installed in /usr/local/lib.
          Some systems do not look here.  You can find out if yours is 
          looking here by running the command:
              more /etc/ld.so.conf
      
          And checking to see if the line:
              /usr/local/lib
          
          Is listed.  If it is not, you can add it here, or you can choose
          to build Aiksaurus's files in a different directory.  For example,
          you could run:
             ./configure --prefix=/usr
	   
          Then do the make, make install again, and try recompiling your
          program.

          The easiest way is just to add the line to /etc/ld.so.conf.
