    Build Problems and Solutions
   
      1.  thesaurus programs fail on startup with 'cannot open shared 
          library libAikSaurus.so.0'

 	  By default, libAikSaurus.so.0 is installed in /usr/local/lib.
	  Some systems do not look here.  You can find out if yours is 
	  looking here by running strace on the program, and seeing 
	  where it looks for the shared libraries. 
	  If your system does not look in /usr/local/lib, or if you're
	  unsure, you can try the following:
	 	./configure --prefix=/usr
	  Then do the make, make install again, and try recompiling your
	  program.
