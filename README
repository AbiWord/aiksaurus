Thesaurus Development
=====================

There is some good documentation available at the developer section
of the web site:

If you want to do work on the thesaurus data, i.e. add synonyms or
so forth, please visit

    https://web.archive.org/web/20031020210259/http://www.aiksaurus.com/developers/datatools/

The data tools are very large (~100MB!) so I've kept them out of CVS.


Feel free to contact me with any questions!  I'd love to hear about
what you're working on.
