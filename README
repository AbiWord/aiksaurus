Thesaurus Development
=====================

* POSSIBLY OBSOLETE INFO *

If you want to do work on the thesaurus data, i.e. add synonyms or 
so forth, please contact Jared Davis <jared@cs.utexas.edu> and ask
for a copy of the data tools.  They are about 100 MB so I am not 
going to put them in CVS.
