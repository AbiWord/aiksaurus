   Build Problems and Solutions
   
     1.  thesaurus programs fail on startup with 'cannot open shared 
         library libAikSaurus.so.0'

	 By default, libAikSaurus.so.0 is installed in /usr/local/lib.
	 Some systems do not look here.  You can find out if yours is 
	 looking here by running strace on the program, and seeing 
	 where it looks for the shared libraries. 
	 If your system does not look in /usr/local/lib, or if you're
	 unsure, you can try the following:
	 	./configure --prefix=/usr
	 Then do the make, make install again, and try recompiling your
	 program.


  If you have a problem not in this list, please submit a bug report. 
 
 
  Thanks,
