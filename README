If you want to do work on the thesaurus data, i.e. add synonyms or 
so forth, please visit 

    http://www.aiksaurus.com/developers/datatools/

The data tools are very large (~100MB!) so I've kept them out of CVS.


Feel free to contact me with any questions!  I'd love to hear about 
what you're working on.
