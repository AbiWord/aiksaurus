    Quick Instructions:        
       	1.  run './configure'   (without the 'quotes')
    	2.  run 'make'
    	3.  run 'make install'
	
	
    Build Problems and Solutions
   
      1.  thesaurus programs fail on startup with 'cannot open shared 
          library libAikSaurus.so.0'

 	  By default, libAikSaurus.so.0 is installed in /usr/local/lib.
	  Some systems do not look here.  You can find out if yours is 
	  looking here by running strace on the program, and seeing 
	  where it looks for the shared libraries. 
	  If your system does not look in /usr/local/lib, or if you're
	  unsure, you can try the following:
	 	./configure --prefix=/usr
	  Then do the make, make install again, and try recompiling your
	  program.

	  Most operating systems have an environment variable such as
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH that you can set - e.g., in bash, type:

		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	  Check the man page for your system's run-time linker (ld.so,
	  dyld, etc.)

	  Alternatively, when configuring AikSaurus, try:

		./configure --disable-shared [OPTIONS]

	  which will prevent shared libraries from being built.

AbiWord Plugin
=======================================================================

    Update
    ------
    AikSaurus is now one of AbiWord's default plugins. It is *highly*
    recommended that you build it within the abiword-plugins framework.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Quick Instructions:
        1.  Compile core library as above.
        2.  cd gtk
        3.  make
        4.  cd abiPlugin
        5.  make

    You should now have a file named AiksaurusABI.so

    Use AbiWord's "plugins" dialog to install the plugin.
