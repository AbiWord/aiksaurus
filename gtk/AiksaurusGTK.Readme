  ==============================================================

   Each source file here contains a .Readme file, which 
   describes what it's supposed to do.  You're advised to spend
   the five minutes and go through these files before you try
   to start hacking on this.  


     AiksaurusGTK_utils
       Just contains a couple of utility string functions.


     AiksaurusGTK_strlist
       Provides a simpler interface to a GList of strings. 
       Used primarily by AiksaurusGTK_histlist.


     AiksaurusGTK_histlist
       Manages the items in the "search" drop-down box so 
       that the main class doesn't need to.

  
     AiksaurusGTK_icons
       XPM icons for the program.
