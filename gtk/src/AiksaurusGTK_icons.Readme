  AiksaurusGTK_icons
  ------------------

    This file is just the icons used in the toolbars and so forth.
   
    We use pixmaps and compile them right into the program, because that way 
    we don't have to be opening external files, so it is much simpler in terms
    of a maintenance perspective.
