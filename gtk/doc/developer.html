<p>This document discusses how to use AiksaurusGTK in your own programs.  It does
<em>not</em> cover the Aiksaurus core library.  If you want to use the Aiksaurus 
core library to do something like create a new interface to Aiksaurus in something
other than GTK, you should read the core library documentation instead.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>AiksaurusGTK allows you to easily create a modal thesaurus dialog within your 
application.  This is almost certainly what you want if you're doing any kind of 
text editing software -- the user selects the word, then pops up the thesaurus 
and chooses a replacement.
</p>


<h3>Interface Reference</h3>

<p>The interface is fairly self-explanatory:</p>

<dl><dt><strong>AiksaurusGTK::AiksaurusGTK()</strong></dt>
<dd>Construct an AiksaurusGTK object.  Generally the first thing you do 
when you're ready to pop up the thesaurus.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><strong>void AiksaurusGTK::setTitle(const char* title)</strong></dt>
<dd>Set the title of the thesaurus window.  This lets you customize the 
dialog, i.e. say something like "AbiWord Thesaurus" or "Evolution Thesaurus".
The default title is simply "Aiksaurus".
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><strong>void AiksaurusGTK::setInitialMessage(const char* message)</strong></dt>
<dd>If the thesaurus is activated with no word selected, you can pass this 
initial message to the user.  You should look at gtkAiksaur.t.cpp to see how
the standalone program uses this.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><strong>void hideReplacebar()</strong></dt>
<dd>If you want to have no "replace-with" bar on your thesaurus, you can use this.
This probably isn't what you want if you're wanting to have the thesaurus integrated
with your project -- it was added mainly for the standalone version.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><strong>const char* runThesaurus(const char* word)</strong></dt>
<dd>Call this function to pop up the thesaurus dialog in a modal setting.
'word' is the word you want to be searched for initially.  Return value
is the user's new selection.
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Distribution Issues</h3>

<p>Adding AiksaurusGTK to your program will incur you two dependencies:
one on AiksaurusGTK and one on Aiksaurus itself.  These packages both 
have configure scripts and should be easy to turn into RPMs or DEBs or
binaries or whatever you want to package them as.
