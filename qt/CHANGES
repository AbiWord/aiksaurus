Kaiksaur Change Log
--------------------

Version 0.02
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Jared Davis:

	Removed unnecessary search.gif.  
	
	Changed to aiksaurus-0.08c codebase, which fixed a problemw with words 
	not always returning the right results and weird characters being 
	displayed.

	Many many implementation changes.

	Changed tab bar to keep current tab as you jump through words.  For ex,
	if you search for "foo" and then hit "verbs", then click on "bar", which
	is one of foo's synonyms, then you will see the results for "bar" but 
	you will still be on the verbs tab instead of jumping to the noun's tab
	like it used to.
	
	Changed makefile to fix bug with not being able to read data directory.
	


Version 0.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Jared Davis:	
	
	Implemented basic KDE interface.  This is a very buggy program and 
	the installer sucks.  Come back later.  Based on aiksaurus-0.08b
