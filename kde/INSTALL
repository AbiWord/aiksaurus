OK-- this is really sloppy, so I'm sorry.
Hopefully soon i'll figure out how to make those sweet ./configure scripts and so forth.


Step 1: you need to install bzip2 development libraries.
  
  You can download this from my web site:
  	http://aiken.clan11.com/aiksaurus/download.php

  Build that, it has a decent setup script.



Step 2: you need to install the kde and qt development libraries.

  This has been developed on qt 2.3.0, kde 2.1.  Other versions may or may not work.

  KDE is available from www.kde.org, QT from www.trolltech.com. 



Step 3: set up QTDIR and KDEDIR in makefile.

  If you went through the install for kde and qt, you should have set up QTDIR
  and KDEDIR in your env.  In this case, you might be able to just comment out
  those lines of the makefile.  Otherwise, edit the top of the makefile and 
  change QTDIR and KDEDIR to match your system.


Step 4: run make

  Running 'make' will create the program but it will need to be installed still.

  Running 'make install' will install the program.
    datafiles are copied to /usr/share/aiksaurus/
    executable kaiksaur is copied to /usr/bin/

  Running 'make uninstall' will uninstall the program.
    rm -rf /usr/share/aiksaurus
    rm -f /usr/bin/kaiksaur

  You will obviously need to be root to run make install/uninstall.

Step 5: run kaiksaur.

  You should be able to run 'kaiksaur' from the command line as a regular user.


Thanks,
let me know how it turns out.

I'll try to get something decent going here pretty soon.
